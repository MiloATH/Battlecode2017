# Battlecode 2017
# Team: test bot please ignore
Battlecode bot for MIT Battlecode 2017. Team consisted of Stuart Johnson and Milo Hartsoe.  
A post-mortem of my experiences can be found at http://goo.gl/0NL6QC

We ranked 36 in the league running up to the qualifying tournament, and made it to the top 32 teams there.  

Matches were decided in a best of three on maps unseen up until the competition. Format was double elimination bracket to ensure the sixteen best teams made it to the finals. We ended up one win away from this, which is disappointing.  
 
The submitted code was from the package masslumber.
